# aceR

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/josegallegos07/aceR.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/josegallegos07/aceR)

`aceR` is an R package around ACE data. 

## Getting Started

See [here](inst/docs/getting-started.md) for a detailed install guide and annotated example.

## Installation

`aceR` is currently only available on github.

Install the latest release from github using [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools):

```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("joaquinanguera/aceR")
```

## Updates

Reinstall the package to update to the latest **stable** version:

```
devtools::install_github("joaquinanguera/aceR")
```

To install the beta version, use `"joaquinanguera/aceR@development"` in the above command. Please be aware that the beta version may have breaking changes relative to your current setup, or just bugs!

The package, as of March 2020, has transitioned to the [CalVer](https://calver.org/) versioning system, with the `0Y.MINOR.MICRO` setup.

- `0Y`: Zero-padded short year. It is assumed that if the year version rolls over, there are breaking changes between this and the last version dated to the previous year.
- `MINOR`: Minor version. The minor version will be rolled over for any of the following. These changes are likely to be breaking to your current pipeline.
    - new functions are added
    - existing functions take a different argument structure
    - existing functions output different data structure
- `MICRO`: Bug fixes. The micro version will be rolled over when internal cleanup or other changes are made that _should_ have no obvious impact to the user.

### Brief release notes

### 21.7.0 (Current):

New features:

- `proc_by_module()` on (forwards and backwards) spatial span now returns a modified spatial span, (`span_overall` / `length_overall`) + `span_correct`, in addition to the original `span_overall` metric
- `post_clean_chance()` now cleans Filter responses _independently_ by k for each of the 5 target/distractor number conditions. Subthreshold performance on one k condition will leave metrics intact for the other conditions.
- clarified some argument descriptions in the `post_clean_chance()` help page

#### 21.6.0:

New features:

- `trim_initial_trials()` allows discarding the first N trials or the first N% of trials from each participant's raw trialwise data loaded in with `load_*_bulk()`
- `proc_by_module()` now returns attention span measures (time between mistakes) for ACE Explorer SAAT data

Minor implementation changes:

- `post_clean_low_trials()` now passes through data from subjects with `NA` in any of their relevant trial count columns. Notable for ACE Explorer BRT data, where some versions of data do not have thumb-press conditions, but data remain valid as the participant could not have possibly responded to those trials.
- `proc_by_module()` now returns `NA` in all overall metric columns for Boxed and TNT task data from subjects who failed to complete every condition (on the basis that they did not actually complete the full task)

Bug fixes:

- Bug likely introduced in v21.2.0: `load_ace_bulk()` was not correctly applying post-hoc just-in-case cleaning of trial accuracy and RT columns to SAAT data since it was split into submodules for `SAATSUSTAINED` and `SAATIMPULSIVE`
- `post_clean_*()` now handle wide-processed ACE Classroom data properly (module-specific BID and time columns)
- `proc_ace_complete()` incorporates these fixes, now handles ACE Classroom data properly as well

#### 21.5.0:

New features:

- Now handles ACE Explorer modules: ADP (face switch) and Color Selection
- Now outputs hit, miss, correct rejection, and false alarm counts for modules where d' is calculated (SAAT, TNT, Filter)

Bug fixes:

- Now throws an error when `load_ace_bulk()` is called with `data_type = "classroom"`, as this argument value has been deprecated since [v21.1.1](#21-1-1) in favor of the more specific options of `"email"` and `"pulvinar"`

Minor implementation changes:

- Filter now uses `proc_by_condition()` under the hood for d' and k, consistent with other modules that calculate d'

#### 21.4.0:

New features:

- `post_reduce_cols()` now takes an additional argument `metric_names_exclude` to _drop_ all column names matching a particular string stem
- `load_sea_bulk()` now identifies practice trials in newer versions of SEA data and groups them with the data for their respective modules. These trials are left in the loaded trialwise data, but ignored when calculating metrics with `proc_by_module()`.

Bug fixes:

- Typo fixed so that SEA reading comprehension and reading fluency both process through `proc_by_module()`
- Processed SEA arithmetic verification cost columns renamed to de-duplicate different cost types
- Fixes bug introduced in v21.0.0 that caused some older SEA files not to load in via `load_sea_bulk()` when they are missing the `math_recall_orientation` column. Again, we do not impute any values for that column (so metrics can't be calculated by Math Recall orientation if it's not there) but the rest of the modules in the file will load in as normal again.

Minor implementation changes:

- Couple more columns in SEA data are coerced to lowercase to smoothen subsequent module processing
- More tests written to check that SEA processing returns no errors, etc.

#### 21.3.0:

**Contains critical change to data calculations, please update ASAP.**

New functions:

- `proc_ace_complete()` is a new wrapper function that allows users who do not wish to modify any arguments to run ACE data through, start to finish. This function calls the following workhorse functions, in order. **Use with care!** The wrapper function effectively hard-codes argument settings for the component data processing functions. Users who wish to tinker with arguments and mid-processing choices should continue to use the functions for individual data processing steps.
 - `load_ace_bulk()`
 - `trim_rt_trials_range(cutoff_min = 200)`
 - `proc_by_module(output = "wide")`
 - `post_clean_low_trials(.min_trials = 5)`
 - optionally, `post_clean_chance(cutoff_dprime = 0, cutoff_2choice = 0.5, cutoff_4choice = 0.25)` with `overall` set based on user preference
 - `post_reduce_cols()` with a specific subset of output columns
 - and writes processed data to CSV with `write_csv()`

Bug fixes:

- **Calculation has been changed, please re-run your stuff!** Thank you [@mattminder](https://github.com/joaquinanguera/aceR/issues/32) for identifying that `ace_dprime()` was incorrectly calculating the denominator of hit and false alarm rate across _all_ trials, instead of _only_ across hit/miss and CR/FA trials respectively. This impacts d' metrics for SAAT and TNT data, not Filter data. (Importantly, the incorrect calculation changed d' values, tending to make them _lower_, but should not have affected rank-order relationships between participants' d' scores.)
- `post_clean_chance()` was not fully updated to expect the two split SAAT modules. It should be now!

#### 21.2.0:

**Major** implementation changes that may break current pipelines:

- The ACE SAAT task is now treated as two separate modules, `SAATSUSTAINED` and `SAATIMPULSIVE`. **`load_ace_bulk()` takes raw SAAT as per usual, but now outputs the trialwise data as two separate modules.** This should work for all ACE data types, no matter whether both SAAT conditions are included in the same log file (ACE Classroom) or exported as distinct log files (ACE Explorer). `proc_by_module()` and the `post_clean_*()` processing functions all now expect SAAT data to be broken up into two submodules, as output by the updated `load_ace_bulk()`. Now, SAAT processed output columns will take the form `SAATIMPULSIVE.XYZ.overall` instead of, say, `SAAT.XYZ.impulsive`. Overall SAAT metrics across both task conditions will no longer be output, as the conditions are cognitively distinct enough that they should not be analyzed together.

#### 21.1.1:

Minor implementation changes:

- `load_ace_bulk()` argument `app_type` has been **renamed** to `data_type` to clarify the fact that it differentiates data varieties from the same app (like emailed vs Pulvinar-style data from ACE Classroom), and to avoid user mental interference with other functions where `app_type` differentiates between `"classroom"` and `"explorer"`
- `load_ace_bulk(data_type = "email")`/`load_ace_bulk(data_type = "pulvinar")` now recodes all valid (>0) BRT RTs as "correct" before adjusting for other app behavior. This should adjust for older versions of the app marking late BRT RTs as "incorrect", which is technically invalid because it's impossible to give an incorrect BRT response.
- Both `post_clean_*()` functions now take a new argument, `extra_demos`, to allow users to pass in a character vector of custom demographic columns to pass through to the cleaned processed data. In the event that users hand-code processed data from `proc_by_module()` with new demographic identifiers, they can now manually specify those columns to be handled with app-default demographics.

#### 21.1.0:

New outputs:

- `load_ace_bulk()` now creates the `trial_number` column if it's not found in the raw data, counting from 0 for each participant/module/condition (so, like in the Boxed task, counting will start over from 0 for the next condition by the same participant). Should only activate for data from very old versions of ACE, where trial number was not automatically written out by the app.

Major implementation changes:
- `load_ace_bulk()` now NAs out all RTs less than 150 ms as "no response".
- `trim_rt_trials()` previously did both range-based and SD-based scrubbing, always doing any SD scrubbing _after_ range scrubbing. These features have now been split into two functions, `trim_rt_trials_range()` and `trim_rt_trials_sd()`, to allow for greater customization of the behavior of either function. Both functions now allow certain modules to be un-scrubbed with the `exclude` argument. `trim_rt_trials_range()` now takes two length-1 arguments for the minimum and maximum range cutoffs, as opposed to the old functionality where both cutoffs were specified in a length-2 vector.

Minor implementation changes:

- `post_clean_chance()` now takes an `app_type` argument with either `"classroom"` or `"explorer"` as values, to account for differing numbers of choices (and differing chance-level accuracy values) in the Task Switch task between ACE Classroom and Explorer.
- Slowly, app output messages are being rendered in color with the [`crayon`](https://github.com/r-lib/crayon) package. Successful processing messages should be rendered in green, non-fatal warnings rendered in yellow, and errors rendered in red.

#### 21.0.1:

Bug fixes:

- `ace_dprime()` (called under the hood to process summaries for SAAT and TNT, among others) now explicitly calculates hit and FA counts with `na.rm = TRUE`, so should stop returning NA for participants with trials NA'd out by cleaning functions like `trim_rt_trials()`.

#### 21.0.0:

New outputs:

- `proc_by_module()` now outputs additional accuracy columns from a recoded version of accuracy, where all late trials are labeled as incorrect irrespective of their original response. (Only appears in data with valid RT/response-window mappings. May not appear for very old ACE Classroom data.)

Minor implementation changes:

- Removing instances of deprecated `dplyr` functions like `funs()` (totally removed?) and the `*_at()`/`*_if()` functions (in progress) to keep up with best practice and silence deprecation errors from `dplyr`
- Subtle changes under the hood to silence cosmetic warnings that don't signify unexpected failure to process

#### 20.5.0:

Minor implementation changes:

- `load_ace_bulk()`: Internal changes to `replace_nas()` to accommodate changes in how tibble data types behave with base R bracket indexing. **Fixes a breaking error with aceR and newer versions of tidyverse packages. Package now requires dplyr >= 1.0.0.**
- ACE Explorer Boxed: Now forcibly recodes accuracy based on `button_pressed` and `position_is_top`
- ACE Explorer Filter: Now forcibly recodes accuracy based on `button_pressed` and `cue_rotated`. Retains previous recoding from earlier versions of the task when `button_pressed` was not included.
- ACE BRT: Now more strict about checking for handedness in demographics. If handedness does not match `"right"` or `"left"`, `module_brt()` throws warning through `proc_by_module()`.

#### 20.4.0:

Minor implementation changes:

- ACE BRT: Only Classroom BRT is checked for `rt != inter_time_interval`. Explorer BRT is now unmodified in this respect.

Bug fixes:

- In June (ish?) 2020, ACE Explorer began labeling Flanker cues as A vs. B, instead of A/B vs. C/D. Previous versions of `load_ace_bulk()` would thus accidentally mis-code all responses when `displayed_cue == "B"`. The code now splits Flanker cues into A vs. B or A/B vs. C/D depending on whether C/D are present in the data. **This is a necessary update for anyone looking to process ACE Explorer Flanker data in the new format.**

#### 20.3.0:

Minor implementation changes:

- ACE Explorer task switch: accuracy is now manually recoded to check that the color or shape of the pressed button is equal to either the color or shape displayed, depending on the cue

Bug fixes:

- In June (ish?) 2020, ACE Explorer began collecting and outputting SAAT data as two separate tasks for the impulsive and sustained conditions. Previous versions of `load_ace_bulk()` would accidentally remove data from each player's second SAAT module as "duplicated". The code now considers task condition when de-duplicating raw data. **This is a necessary update for anyone looking to process ACE Explorer SAAT data in the new format.**

#### 20.2.0:

New outputs of `proc_by_module()` added:

- ACE spatial cueing: For newer Explorer data that has a "neutral" condition, outputs costs for neutral - incongruent and neutral - incongruent
- ACE filter: Outputs Snodgrass-corrected d'. Use with caution when trial counts are low!
- ACE modules in general:
    - where response window summaries are output, now outputs minimum response window as well
    - For ACE Explorer data, now outputs `practice_count`, or the number of practice rounds that subject did for that module. Note that at the max value, 5 rounds, it does _not_ currently differentiate between whether the subject maxed out practice and failed the last round, or passed the last round.

Bug fixes:

- `proc_by_module()` failed when `app_type = "explorer"` and `output = "wide"` because it attempted to drop a column that didn't exist in demographics
- `load_ace_bulk()` now returns all `tap_.*_rt` columns in forward/backward spatial span data as double instead of character
- `post_clean_low_trials()` checks for the minimum trial count only in at-all-responded trials within each condition. Previously, was accidentally checking within early-responded trials, which is likely too strict of a response requirement.

Now requires `dplyr >= 0.8.0` as well. Tidyverse updates are generally solid about backwards compatibility, so we boldly go for more sensible features!

#### 20.1.1:

Previously, no recoding was done on no-go "RTs" in go/no-go ACE tasks (SAAT and TNT). Now, these no-go RTs are coded as **-99**. This is not included in RT summary statistics, but these trials are counted in `ace_count()`.

#### 20.1.0:

New functions `nest_ace_raw()` and `unnest_ace_raw()`, to pull loaded ACE data into traditional unnested dataframe form for custom analysis, and to re-package ACE data back into nested form for analysis with `proc_by_module()`.

### Branches

#### master

Stable release branch. Supports the **newest** version of the ACE Explorer app. **Mostly backwards compatible** with data from older ACE apps (e.g. ACE Classroom). However, early builds of ACE Classroom were often unstable, and there may be idiosyncratic problems in legacy ACE Classroom data that cannot be repaired by `aceR`.

#### development 

Development of new features, i.e. non-trivial changes. All development is for features intended for the `master` branch.

#### classroom

Backwards-compatible stable release branch for data from older ACE apps. Use only when processing older ACE data, for example from ACE Classroom. **No longer actively maintained.**
